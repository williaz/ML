# ML
When the target variable that weâ€™re trying to predict is continuous, we call the learning problem a regression problem. When y can take on only a small number of discrete values, we call it a classification problem
function-hypothesis, data-training set
We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function.
